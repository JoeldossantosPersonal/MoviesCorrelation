# MoviesCorrelation

Overview:

This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a movie correlation analysis project conducted using Jupyter Notebook, Python, and various data analysis libraries. The primary objective of this project was to identify the variables that exhibit the highest correlation coefficient, ultimately allowing us to determine the factors that lead to a high gross profit in the film industry.

The analysis leverages popular Python libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and others, to perform data exploration, visualization, and correlation analysis. Additionally, the project includes a transcript that provides details on hypotheses, findings, and insights derived from SAS, further supporting the analytical process.

Introduction: 

The film industry is a vast and complex domain, with numerous variables contributing to a movie's success. This project aims to uncover the relationships between various factors and the gross profit of movies, providing valuable insights to filmmakers, studios, and investors. By analyzing correlations, we can identify which elements have the most significant impact on a movie's financial success.

Data Sources:

The data used for this analysis is drawn from various movie-related datasets on (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), including information on budgets, box office revenues, genres, directors, actors, and more. These datasets are carefully selected and processed to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the analysis.

Dependencies: 

This project relies on the following Python libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
SAS
